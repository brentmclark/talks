# Where we're going...
### we don't need recompose

---

<ul>
<li>JavaScript devs</li>
<Appear>
    <li>want to ship faster</li>
    <li>worked with or know about redux</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

---

<ul>
<li>Find redux confusing</li>
<Appear>
    <li>complicated</li>
    <li>too much boilerplate</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

---

# Thunks and Sagas

To join together our fetch logic and action creators

---

# Reselect

To address selector performance

---

# Boilerplate Intensified

So we brought in <u>Recompose</u>

---

<ul>
<li>in-flight tracking was suboptimal</li>
<Appear>
    <li>duplicated (poorly) everywhere</li>
    <li>sometimes overlooked</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

---

<ul>
<li>Error handling became inconsistent</li>
<Appear>
    <li>duplicated (poorly) everywhere</li>
    <li>often overlooked</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

---

# Indirection was fierce

tracing from component to reducer grew more complex

---

# New domain model... FML
##### Every new domain model required a full suite of CRUD operations

---

# Things started to fall apart

---

<ul>
<li>Performance suffered greatly</li>
<Appear>
    <li>Maintainability was at an all-time low</li>
    <li>State-related tasks were unapproachable to new devs</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

### Only 1 person knew how all of this worked
##### (let's call him Brent)

---

# Brent the Bottleneck

---

# deadlines were missed

---

# Something had to change

---

# Found apollo client

---

# Found `apollo-link-rest`

---

# query colocation
##### And other things dramitically reduce indirection

---

# fetching and caching combined

Consistent in-flight indication and error handling

---

# One tool, One Doc Site

Made API cache management approachable for all

---

# Boilerplate Greatly reduced

---

# More resilient code

Due to typed, client-side query language

---

# Performance improves greatly

---

# Delivery speed increases

---

# Deadlines met

---

# Work became fun again

---

# <u>Demo Time</u>
